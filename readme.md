# Guitar Neck Detection Program

## Overview
This project is a computer vision program designed to detect the neck of a guitar in real-time from video input or images. Using techniques such as object detection, the program is capable of identifying and drawing bounding boxes around the guitar neck, making it useful for applications such as automated tuning, guitar playing analysis, or general image recognition tasks.

##  Features
Real-time detection of the guitar neck from a webcam feed.
Support for static image processing.
Bounding box drawing on detected areas.
Model built using PyTorch with the SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) algorithm.
Fine-tuning capabilities for custom datasets.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

> Python 3.x
> PyTorch
> OpenCV (for handling webcam input and displaying images)
> Torchvision
> NumPy
You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How It Works
1. The program processes the input (image or webcam feed) frame by frame.
2. It applies the SSD model to predict the presence of the guitar neck within the frame.
3. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected guitar necks.
4. Results are displayed in real-time or saved as images (depending on the mode).

## Model Architecture
This program utilizes a pre-trained SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) model, fine-tuned for detecting guitar necks. The model takes an input image and generates bounding boxes along with classification scores for the regions that contain the guitar neck.
